# Declaration File (`index.d.ts`)

This `index.d.ts` file contains TypeScript declarations for various types, interfaces, and other declarations used in the project. It provides type information for different data structures and enhances type safety and IntelliSense support in TypeScript code.

## Purpose

The purpose of this file is to declare the structure of different types, interfaces, and other declarations used throughout the project. By defining TypeScript types, interfaces, and other declarations, it ensures consistency, type safety, and better development experience when working with data in the project.

## Content

```typescript
// Define User type
declare type User = {
  $id: string;
  email: string;
  userId: string;
  firstName: string;
  lastName: string;
  age: int;
  admin: boolean;
};

// Define Product interface
interface Product {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  price: number;
  description: string;
  category: string;
}

// Define Order type
declare type Order = {
  orderId: string;
  items: Product[];
  total: number;
  status: "Pending" | "Processing" | "Shipped" | "Delivered";
  createdAt: Date;
};

// Define Comment interface
interface Comment {
  id: number;
  postId: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  body: string;
}

// Declare global constants
declare const API_URL: string;
declare const MAX_RETRIES: number;

// Declare custom utility functions
declare function formatDate(date: Date): string;

// Define any other types, interfaces, or declarations you need...
```

This declaration file includes various types such as `User`, `Product`, `Order`, `Comment`, as well as interfaces and other declarations such as constants and utility functions.

## Writing the Declaration File

1. **Use `declare type` for type declarations**: Define types using the `declare type` keyword followed by the type name.

2. **Use `interface` for object shapes**: Define object shapes using the `interface` keyword followed by the interface name.

3. **Separate types, interfaces, and other declarations with comments**: Use comments to separate different types, interfaces, and other declarations for better readability.

4. **Declare global constants and utility functions**: Use `declare const` for global constants and `declare function` for custom utility functions.

5. **Define all necessary types, interfaces, and declarations**: Ensure to define all types, interfaces, and other declarations needed for your project.

## Next Steps

After writing the `index.d.ts` file, ensure that it is included in your project and accessible to TypeScript. You can import these types, interfaces, and other declarations wherever they are needed in your TypeScript codebase.
