# Prisma: Modern Database Toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js

## Introduction

Prisma is a modern database toolkit for TypeScript and Node.js that simplifies database access with a type-safe and auto-generated query builder. It provides a powerful ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) solution for working with databases, enabling developers to focus on building applications rather than dealing with complex SQL queries.

## Features

- **Type-safe Database Access**: Prisma generates a type-safe query builder based on your database schema, allowing you to write queries in TypeScript with full type safety.

- **Auto-generated API**: Prisma automatically generates a fully-typed and documented CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) API based on your database schema, reducing boilerplate code and making database interactions straightforward.

- **Migration Management**: Prisma supports database schema migrations, allowing you to evolve your database schema over time while keeping track of changes using a version-controlled migration system.

- **Performance**: Prisma optimizes database queries for performance and efficiency, providing features like query batching and caching to minimize database roundtrips and improve application performance.

## Getting Started

To start using Prisma in your project, follow these steps:

1. **Install Prisma CLI**: If you haven't already, install the Prisma CLI globally on your machine using npm or yarn:

   ```bash
   npm install -g prisma
   # or
   yarn global add prisma
   ```
````

2. **Initialize Prisma Project**: Create a new Prisma project by running the following command in your project directory:

   ```bash
   prisma init
   ```

   This command will guide you through the process of initializing a new Prisma project and configuring your database connection.

3. **Define Database Schema**: Define your database schema using Prisma Schema Language (PSL) in the `schema.prisma` file. This file describes your database schema, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints.

4. **Generate Prisma Client**: Generate the Prisma Client by running the following command:

   ```bash
   prisma generate
   ```

   This command generates a fully-typed Prisma Client based on your database schema, which you can use to interact with your database in TypeScript.

5. **Use Prisma Client in Your Application**: Import and use the Prisma Client in your application code to perform database operations. Here's an example of how to use Prisma Client to query data:

   ```typescript
   import { PrismaClient } from "@prisma/client";

   const prisma = new PrismaClient();

   async function getUsers() {
     return await prisma.user.findMany();
   }
   ```

6. **Run Database Migrations**: If you make changes to your database schema, generate and apply database migrations using the following commands:

   ```bash
   prisma migrate save --name
   prisma migrate up --experimental
   ```

   These commands will generate a new migration file and apply the migration to your database, updating the schema accordingly.
